[China-India Border conflict from 1950-62](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/11f9pen/chinaindia_border_conflict_from_195062/) by /u/chanboi5 ╎ [^archive](https://archive.ph/AGFA4)  | March 1, 2023 | Sino-Indian History | The myth of the Chinese betrayal of India during the border disputes between the two countries is still prevalent despite evidence suggesting a more complex situation. The border dispute in the Western Sector (Aksai Chin) stemmed from India unilaterally changing its official maps in 1954. In the Eastern Sector, the dispute arose from China's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the McMahon Line. Diplomatic miscommunication and suspicion characterized the interactions between India and China. In 1960, China proposed a 'package deal' to resolve the border dispute, but India maintained an inflexible approach. India's Forward Policy sought to establish outposts in the disputed territory, which resulted in increased tensions. Clashes between Indian and Chinese troops eventually escalated into a full-scale conflict, known as the Sino-Indian War of 1962. After several failed ceasefire attempts, China eventually declared a unilateral ceasefire, and both sides withdrew their forces. The Sino-Indian border dispute was not a simple case of Chinese betrayal. Instead, it was a complex situation arising from historically ambiguous borders, miscommunication, and diplomatic failures. While China's invasion of India cannot be justified under international law, it's essential to acknowledge the nuances of the situation rather than blaming either side exclusively. 
[How Indian Public opinion on Ukraine war changed - A detailed analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/11f10qw/how_indian_public_opinion_on_ukraine_war_changed/)by u/Fdsn ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/wip/JzvHb)  |March 1, 2023| Ukraine war | This page is a post by a user who is interested in geopolitics and international relations. The user discusses their perspective on the public sentiment in India towards the war between Ukraine and Russia. Initially, India was highly supportive of Ukraine, but this changed due to various events such as racial discrimination against Indian students in Ukraine, India’s abstention from voting against Russia in the UN, and Ukraine’s past support for Pakistan. The user also discusses the hypocrisy of participating countries and the failure of basic diplomacy. The user concludes that the biggest losers of this war are Ukraine, Russia, Europe, and small countries with weak economies while the biggest winners are oil-producing countries and America. The user believes that this war has made Europeans once again fully dependent on America.
[My analysis of India's ties with Russia - Please critique](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/x0ymp3/my_analysis_of_indias_ties_with_russia_please/)  by u/_23-23-23_ ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/wip/EzDiM) | Aug 30, 2022 | Russia |This page discusses the history of India’s relationships with other countries. In the 1970s, India was aligned with the USSR while the US was aligned with China and Pakistan. After the fall of the USSR in the 1990s, India faced economic and political challenges and became a nuclear country, leading to western sanctions. Russia was India’s only available arms supplier, and their arms deals form the backbone of India’s military. India is now friendlier with the US but still faces a military threat from China and is dependent on Russian spares for its military. Russia has become increasingly unreliable and close to China, leading India to move away from Russian weapons. However, this process takes time, and Russia still has leverage over India. India’s expansion of economic ties with Russia allows it to offset Russia’s military leverage and gives it more room to work with the US against China without needing to consider Russia’s opinion as much.

[A Chinese opinion on India and South Asian geopolitics ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/10jvwnd/a_chinese_opinion_on_india_and_south_asian/)  by u/sadhgurukilledmywife ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/wip/C3ZW0)| Jan 24, 2023 | China |  This post is an extract from a paper by Zheng Yongnian, a well-known Chinese political scientist and director of the Institute for International Affairs at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). The paper, titled “Ten critical shifts in international politics in 2023 and their prospects,” discusses India’s rise due to its comparative advantages in areas such as its economy, policies, and the international situation. Zheng notes that India’s huge and growing population gives it a demographic dividend and a workforce advantage. Prime Minister Modi has been seeking to become India’s version of Deng Xiaoping since coming to power in 2014, with a sustained trend towards reform. The United States views China as its main competitor and has focused its attention on developing a substantive relationship with India. However, India will not become a vassal of the US but will attempt to become an independent pole of power. Supported by the West, India’s determined rise will put considerable geopolitical pressure upon China. How to manage Sino-Indian relations will be an important question for study. 
[Fascinating thread on late Japanee PM Shinzo Abe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/10x2zfz/fascinating_thread_on_late_japanee_pm_shinzo_abes/) by u/GummyBearGrylls ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/Jd6W3)  | Feb 08, 2023 | Japan | This postis about a thread on former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s memoir. The thread mentions Abe’s grandfather Nobusuke Kishi visiting India in 1957 and being introduced by Jawaharlal Nehru to a crowd outside the PM’s office. Nehru told the crowd that Japan gave India the courage to fight the British to gain independence. The thread also mentions Abe proposing the Quad to Manmohan Singh in his first administration (2006-2007) but Singh was hesitant due to concerns about damaging relations with China. In his second administration (2012-2020), Narendra Modi was more understanding and agreed to join the Quad if Japan was going to take the lead. Shinzo Abe’s memoir is a treasure trove of diplomatic anecdotes and has become an instant bestseller. It offers unique insights into the world of diplomacy, including his interactions with Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, and Narendra Modi. 
[Understanding Soros and India: Lobbying, Funding and it's Real Impact.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/117efyz/understanding_soros_and_india_lobbying_funding/) by u/theneoindian ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/btPjT)  | Feb 20, 2023 | George soros | This post is about George Soros and his Open Society Foundation’s funding of organizations in India. The article discusses how some of these donations are legitimate, while others raise questions about foreign influence over domestic opposition. The real issue, according to the article, is the funding of international groups with lobbying power in the western world. The article concludes that there is no global conspiracy against India, but rather an annoyance to the Indian state that affects its soft power in the west. The response to this can be countered by friendly outreach and lobbying on India’s own behalf. The page also includes a brief description of The Neo Indian, a group dedicated to creating intellectual discourse and ideation of relevant policy. 
[State Media and Propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/119ql4z/state_media_and_propaganda/) by  u/nishitd ╎   [^archive](https://archive.is/mRN2e)|Feb 23, 2023 | Mass Media | This post discusses state media and propaganda, specifically in India. The author compares state media outlets such as the BBC, CGTN, and Global Times, and argues that the BBC has good editorial independence while Global Times and CGTN are arms of their respective governments. The author suggests that to improve the credibility of India’s state media outlet Doordarshan, it should be given editorial independence, funding tied to performance, and focus on India rather than the Indian government. The author also discusses private media outlets such as the New York Times, The Guardian, and Al-Jazeera, and argues that they are editorially independent. The author suggests that WION, an English channel by Zee News, seems to be modeled on Al-Jazeera but focuses more on making others look bad than on facts
[US Soft Power Failures in India](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/12qc4c6/us_soft_power_failures_in_india/) by u/sadhgurukilledmywife ╎ [^archive](https://archive.is/iiBKm)|Apr 18, 2023 | United States | The submission discusses how American/Western reporting on India is the greatest diminisher of their soft power in the country. The existence of a free press inevitably leads to countries like Russia having a slight soft power advantage over the West in India. The post also compares how Reuters and RT reported on the Atiq Ahmed situation and how it affects their respective countries’ soft power in India.

The post discusses various issues in India-Nepal relations, including the belief in Nepal that India is blocking their progress, the blockade of Madhesi areas in Nepal, and Nepal’s refusal to reign in fake Indian currency. The post also mentions an incident where a Bhutanese Army contingent was allowed to camp in Kalimpong to guard the Queen Mother and used force to vacate a mansion leased by Shaw Wallace. Shaw Wallace submitted a writ application in the Calcutta High Court against the Government of India for failing to provide protection.

[China's economic crisis: exaggerations and ground reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/13t9j98/chinas_economic_crisis_exaggerations_and_ground/) by u/nishitd ╎ [^archive](https://archive.ph/mB32S) | May 27 2023 | China  | The article discusses China’s phenomenal growth in the last 30 years and how it has been one of the highest in the world. However, there have been predictions that the Chinese bubble will burst, and these predictions have grown louder in recent years due to major events such as a shrinking real estate sector, debt-fueled growth, Zero COVID policy, demographic crisis due to one-child policy, and BRI debt. Despite these concerns, there are no visible effects on the ground in China and some believe that China will only grow stronger.
